## Installation 
After cloning the repository to your local machine, open a terminal and type npm i to install inquirer and jest.

## Usage 
In the terminal, type "node index.js" to invoke inquirer and begin the prompting of questions. First, choose up to three alphanumeric characters or symbols to be displayed in your logo. Then, select a text color by typing the color keyword or by entering a hexadecimal color code. Following this, the user will be prompted to select one of the four shape options and finally, specify a background or fill color for said shape. Again, color can be entered in either format.

## Features 
This project utilizes node.js, fs, inquirer for prompting the user, and Jest for testing. It also contains a suite of tests to check that all shapes render properly. The use of object-oriented programming is featured heavily in this application, along with class constructors and parent-child inheritance.
